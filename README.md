## Self-Reflection:
The cyprus stuff was a little confusing and I was getting some issues on running it. I could get it to run but was getting some issues. I also ran into some file issues which was a consequence of me not commiting regularly. This probably lead to the issues I was having. I had to manually add in the cypus files. 


### How long it took me to finish this?

This took me quite a little due to some file issues that I was having.
